His personal best stands at 89.94m which was achieved in 2022. His season begins in May with the Diamond League and would mark the competitive start of his partnership with Zelezny, a former Olympic and world champion who also holds the world record (98.48m).<q> I believe a 90+ throw is happening soon. He (Jan Zelezny) has made some technical adjustments in my game,</q>said Chopra.<q> He (Zelezny) feels that his tweaks would help me. Ive been able to understand what he expects from me. One of the mistakes that he told me about was how I was throwing very low even in Paris and that I was leaning towards the left.</q><q>If I am able to incorporate those changes, I think I will get a lot better,</q> he added.He also spoke about the groin injury that marred his season last year. Chopra has consulted a doctor recommended by Zelezny in Prague.<br>Opening about his marriage that stunned everyone, Chopra said both he and Mor wanted it to be an intimate affair and that's why they chose a town near Solan.</p>
