<p> <q> I believe a 90+ throw is happening soon. He (Jan Zelezny) has made some technical adjustments in my game,</q>said Chopra.<br> <q> He (Zelezny) feels that his tweaks would help me. Ive been able to understand what he expects from me. One of the mistakes that he told me about was how I was throwing very low even in Paris and that I was leaning towards the left.</q> <br> <q>If I am able to incorporate those changes, I think I will get a lot better,</q> he added.<br>He also spoke about the groin injury that marred his season last year. Chopra has consulted a doctor recommended by Zelezny in Prague.<br>Opening about his marriage that stunned everyone, Chopra said both he and Mor wanted it to be an intimate affair and that's why they chose a town near Solan.</p>
